# battery-interface-api
We made the battery interface simulation based on uinsg the PhaseTree software. Our approach to simulate the battery interface is separated for two steps - material properties explorer using cluster expansion and battery interface simulation using the phase-field simulation. The cluster expansion is a useful tool getting the material properties mostly faster than other atomic simulation tools. The material properties from the cluster expansion simulation shoud be archived for the user and can use it for the phase-field simulation. Phase-field method is a popular tool for simulating the interface of the battery using Finite Element Method (FEM) due to allowing to run clear phase separate simulation. 

This document aims to run the phase-field simulation and how to run this application. User need to follow this simple instruction for running this simulation.
```
    1. Make the JSON file refering to below "Input file description".
    2. Submit the job using battery-interface-api.
        2-1. Check the status of the calculation until the simulation is done.
    3. Retrive the result from the simulation using the battery-interface-api if the simulation is done.

"params" hold the all of the informations of parameter for running simulation. The parameters can be getting from the literature research using the experiments or density functional theory. But, It also can take the parameters from the CLEASE.

## Mesh setup
Battery-interface-api basically operate the simulation on the square domain. We can generate the mesh calculating the FEM problem if user define the size and number of element of the quad element for simulation. 
    
* "size_x" [μm]: size of the domain along x-axis.
* "size_y" [μm]: size of the domain along y-axis.
* "nx": number of the quad elements along x-axis. The element of the x-axis is limited to 100 due to the simulation time.
* "ny": number of the quad elements along y-axis. The element of the y-axis is also limited to 100 due to the simulation time.

## Time calcuation setup
User need to define the simulation time. 

* "max_time" [s]: time to stop the calculation. highly recommend to put lower than 50 s.
* "interval" [s]: time to save the results of simulation. recommend ranges are 0.01 s < "interval" < 0.1 s.
* "calc_interval" [s]: time interval for running simulation. recommend ranges are 0.0001 s < "interval" < 0.01 s.


# Setup environment
The application is operated with PhaseTree software on the internet. So you must be connected on internet. Hghly recommend to install Python 3.6 or newer.
